# flutter_project1
In this project, I created a profile page using Flutter in VSCode.

### In case of an error in debugging, try to run the following two commands in the terminal!

```
flutter clean
```

The first command is to clean the cache inside the folder. The second is commanded for more Flutter packages.
```
flutter pub get
```

Enjoy!
